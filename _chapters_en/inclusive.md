## Code of Conduct {#s:inclusive-conduct}

A CoC lays out the expectations for interpersonal interaction in your project.
The CoC that we suggest using is the [Contributor Covenant][covenant],
which provides examples of acceptable and unacceptable behavior for your project,
and specifies how unacceptable behavior will be handled.
The goal of this is to explicitly communicate the standards of interaction to which this project holds its participants,
and encourage newcomers to the project to engage with the project.

This serves several purposes:

-   It reduces the uncertainty that project participants face about what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior.
    While you might think this is obvious,
    long experience suggests that articulating it clearly and concisely reduces problems caused by have different expectations.

-   It welcomes newcomers specifically, which can help grow your project and encourage user feedback.

-   It delineates responsibilities within the project and provides specific points of contact in case of misconduct or harassment,
    as well as specifying the process to be followed in these cases.

We find that most people agree with the standards laid out in the Contributor Covenant,
and believe that posting it entails no disadvantage.

-   Important to make clear:
    -   How to report
    -   Who handles

## Ally Skills {#s:inclusive-ally}

-   Drawn primarily from [Frameshift Consulting Ally Skills Workshop][ally-skills]
    -   Which you should do
-   Privilege: an unearned advantage given by society to some people but not all
-   Oppression: systemic, pervasive inequality that benefits the privileged and harms those without privilege
-   Target: someone who suffers from oppression
    -   Often called "a member of a marginalized group", but that phrasing is deliberately passive
    -   Targets don't choose to be marginalized: those with privilege marginalize them
-   Ally: a member of a privileged group who is working to understand their own privilege and end oppression
-   Example
    -   Privilege: being able to walk into a store and have the owner assume you're there to buy things, not to steal them
    -   Oppression: the self-perpetuating stories told about (for example) indigenous people being thieves,
        and the actions people take as a result of them
    -   Target: an indigenous person who wants to buy milk
    -   Ally: a white person who pays attention to lesson like this one (raising their own awareness),
        calls out peers who spread racist stories (peer action),
        or asks the shopkeeper whether they should leave too (situational action)
-   Why be an ally?
    -   Because you've benefited, even if you don't realize it
    -   The donut argument
    -   Because taking action to value diversity results in worse performance ratings for minority and female leaders,
        while ethnic majority or male leaders who do this aren't penalized [[Hekm2017](#CITE)]
1.  Be short, simple, firm
1.  Don't try to be funny
1.  Play for the audience
1.  Practice simple responses
1.  Pick your battles
1.  Don't shame or insult one group when trying to help another
    -   E.g., don't call someone ugly or stupid when what you really mean is that they're racist or homophobic
-   [Captain Awkward][captain-awkward] has useful advice
-   [Charles' Rules of Argument][charles-rules]
    1.  Don't go looking for an argument
    1.  State your position once, speaking to the audience
    1.  Wait for absurd replies
    1.  Reply once more to correct any misunderstandings of your original statement
    1.  Do not reply again - go do something fun instead
-   Recognize that good principles sometimes conflict
    -   "A manager consistently uses male pronouns to refer to software and people of unknown gender.
        When you tell them it makes you uncomfortable to treat maleness as the norm,
        they say that male is the default gender in their first language
        and you should be more considerate of people from other cultures."
    -   Respect for other cultures vs. being inclusive of women
-   Change the terms of the debate
    -   "Diversity hires" vs. ball and chain argument
