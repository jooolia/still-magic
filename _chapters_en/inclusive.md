## Code of Conduct {#s:inclusive-conduct}

A CoC lays out the expectations for interpersonal interaction in your project.
The CoC that we suggest using is the [Contributor Covenant][covenant],
which provides examples of acceptable and unacceptable behavior for your project,
and specifies how unacceptable behavior will be handled.
The goal of this is to explicitly communicate the standards of interaction to which this project holds its participants,
and encourage newcomers to the project to engage with the project.

This serves several purposes:

-   It reduces the uncertainty that project participants face about what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior.
    While you might think this is obvious,
    long experience suggests that articulating it clearly and concisely reduces problems caused by have different expectations.

-   It welcomes newcomers specifically, which can help grow your project and encourage user feedback.

-   It delineates responsibilities within the project and provides specific points of contact in case of misconduct or harassment,
    as well as specifying the process to be followed in these cases.

We find that most people agree with the standards laid out in the Contributor Covenant,
and believe that posting it entails no disadvantage.

-   Important to make clear:
    -   How to report
    -   Who handles
