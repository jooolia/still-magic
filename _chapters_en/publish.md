FIXME
-   What to publish (from <https://hackmd.io/2G2THPHKRH6EtUl2cS53uQ>)
    -   Raw data
    -   Intermediate files that take a long time to generate
    -   Software versions
    -   Software command line flags
    -   Workflows and/or shell scripts
    -   R, Python, etc. scripts and notebooks for analysis and figures
-   Where to publish (same source)
    -   Big raw data - may not be yours in the first place, but needs professional archiving.
    -   Medium-size raw data (between 500 MB and 5 GB): Open Science Framework <osf.io>
    -   Small raw data (under 500 MB): GitHub and [Zenodo][zenodo]
