**Tidy data**{:#g:tidy-data}: tabular data organized so that:
1.  Each variable is in one column.
2.  Each different observation of that variable is in a different row.
3.  There is one table for each "kind" of variable.
4.  If there are multiple tables, each includes a key so that related data can be linked.
