  <strong>August 2018: This material is under very active development,</strong>
  and should considered part of the "brainstorming" section of <a href="http://teachtogether.tech/en/process/">a rational lesson design process</a>.
  If you would like to help us move it forward,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">send us suggestions</a>
  or <a href="{{site.repo}}/issues">file an issue</a> in <a href="{{site.repo}}">our GitHub repository</a>.
  We would particularly appreciate descriptions of common errors and how to fix them;
  there are subsections for these in every lesson.
